These profiles are for ORION and CASSIOPEIA Dremel 3D45 printers. The same settings will not produce the same result for both printers.

Most of these profiles are WIP and will not work for every print. Some profiles are not perfected.
First layers that are not reasonably large and of basic shape will peel off the bed, requires trial and error.

Only use SPEED profiles on non-complex geometery. If the printer is excessively vibrating, skipping steps, or jerking, it is best to cancel the print and use NORMAL.
Part quality is reduced when using SPEED.
NORMAL profiles are optimized for non-glue usage.
Profiles with TEST on the end are profiles which have recently been updated to test new settings to improve print quality. Supervise the printer for a few layers.
