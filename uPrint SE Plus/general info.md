# uPrint SE Plus
## Printer background
The Stratasys uPrint SE Plus (coined the $16,000 Paperweight by it's users) is an industrial FDM 3D printer for professional workflows, offering high part strength and fast prototyping.

The $16,000 Paperweight is the newest uPrint SE Plus in the district. The old printer was dropped by moving staff, and a replacement was ordered. It is confirmed that the $16,000 paperweight is the last uPrint SE Plus in the district.

## Printer maintenance and quirks
It's reliability is unparalled compared to it's $16,000 price tag, requiring heavy maintenance and upkeep. It will have a hot streak of printing parts reliability and quickly, and then suffer from a critical error and require creative thinking to overcome. 

The minor errors it encounters are frequently non-haltable and are inherit of a bad design. The printer trusts that everything is working OK, that filament being used is not dry or extremely brittle. This frequently leads to errors it does not detect and cannot halt from.
### Minor errors
This printer suffers from a multitude of minor errors, mainly caused by brittle/bad filament. Some of these errors are not detectable and the printer will not halt for them, the only intervention is by an operator who observes the error and stops the print.
Minor errors caused by brittle or bad filament:
- Filament breaking in the bowden tubes in transit to the printing head, causing an LOE (Loss of Extrusion) and the part failing without halting.
- Filament breaking in the roll and causing a filament break error. If it breaks beyond the filament runout sensor the printer will have an LOE and the part will fail.
- Filament missing the liquefier input and curling around the drive gear, making a makeshift spring and filling the interior print head with filament.
- Filament missing the liquefier input and grinding against the drive gear, as it lacks the force to overcome the blockage in the liquefier.
- Filament partially missing the liquefier input and splitting, with one half feeding into the liquefier and the other curling around the spring.
